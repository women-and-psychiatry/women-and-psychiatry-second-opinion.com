        <h3>€60 – 45-minute Session</h3>
        <p>
            Structured psychiatric counseling sessions are available online. These are one-on-one, insight-oriented conversations
            designed for patients seeking diagnostic clarity, emotional strategy building, and support navigating complex psychiatric questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Platform:</strong> Teams / WhatsApp Video Call / or whatever platform you feel comfortable with.
        </p>
        <p>
            These sessions are not psychotherapy and do not replace local medical care. They are designed to assist with understanding
            your psychiatric patterns in a contained and respectful space.
