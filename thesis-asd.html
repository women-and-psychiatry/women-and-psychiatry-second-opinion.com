        <p>This thesis explores the intricate relationship between genetic profiles and clinical presentations within the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) population. 
        It investigates how specific genotypic patterns correlate with phenotypic traits, particularly in the context of sex differences. 
        The goal is to enhance diagnostic precision and understanding of ASD heterogeneity, offering insights into more personalized approaches to psychiatric evaluation.</p>

        <p>The study discusses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Common genetic variations associated with ASD</li>
            <li>Sex-linked differences in ASD manifestations</li>
            <li>Challenges in phenotype-based diagnosis</li>
            <li>Implications for future psychiatric assessment frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ultimately, recognizing the nuanced interplay between genotype and phenotype could lead to better, more tailored interventions for individuals across the autism spectrum, 
        reducing diagnostic overshadowing and improving mental health outcomes, especially for underdiagnosed populations like women.</p>
